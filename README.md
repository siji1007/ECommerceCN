The problem that small-scale local artists – especially those based in rural or less-developed regions – experience is the lack of opportunities to reach those bigger markets as they often do not feature prominently, do not possess sufficient marketing expertise, and often suffer from logistical issues. These challenges, in turn, compel artisans to sell directly to middlemen who cut their profits and undermine their business, economic, and cultural sustainability. The Digital Marketplace for Local Artisans: Two of the mentioned issues are solved through the Empowering Sustainable Livelihoods project by developing an online selling market for artisans. This initiative aligns with SDGs including SDG 8 targeting economic growth, SDG 10 targeting ‘equality' and SDG 12 that addresses consumption patterns.
